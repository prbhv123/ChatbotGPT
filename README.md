# OpenAI Chatbot

Welcome to the OpenAI Chatbot project. This chatbot is built using Python and OpenAI's model. It allows users to interact and solve their queries in a conversational manner. The interface of the chatbot is built using the pqd6 library.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main Python files:

1. `main.py`: This file contains the logic for the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the integration of the backend with the frontend.

2. `backend.py`: This file contains the logic for calling the OpenAI API and getting the response. 

In addition to these, there is a requirements.txt file that lists all the Python dependencies that need to be installed for the project to run.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```    

3. Open the `backend.py` file and specify your OpenAI key. You can get this key from the OpenAI website after you sign up.

4. Run the `main.py` file to start the chatbot.

## Usage

Once you have set up the project, you can start interacting with the chatbot. Simply type your query into the text box and press enter. The chatbot will respond with an answer or a follow-up question.
